Word2Vec Model

It can be generated using following two algorithms:
CBOW - Continuous Bag of Words
Skip-grams - Skip the word, look at neighbors


CBOW :
      Use the context (surronding) words to predict the target word.
      It is kind of Fill in the blanck in simple terms.

Skip-grams :
      Use the target word to predict the context (surronding) words.
